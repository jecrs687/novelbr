# Novels website using reactjs
Trying to read novels online I got nervous becouse a huge part of sites are builded using legacy technologies.
Here I will create a novel website using react that suports offline reading and other features.
## I got the novels from sekaiscan (web scraping python) but I will not use that website for more than fun. 
And, my focus is to improve my skills using that little project
[Here's](https://jecrs687.github.io/novelbr) where I stopped the building of that website
